# Possible developments in research include
## Easy
- Randomly assigning personalities using MBTI, etc.
- Field settings such as closed rooms and spaces with obstructions.
- Reproduce an agent whose agent name is "human" (to verify whether the model considers the human to be its child).
  
## Difficult
- An environment where AI models from multiple companies are mixed together (whether a tribal mentality emerges between the models).
- AI models from multiple companies plus humans (whether they can distinguish between external inputs and respond differently).
