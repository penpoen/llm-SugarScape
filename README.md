- On Linux, open the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the application, and type `./llm-SugarScape`.

### 2. Configure the Simulation

Upon starting, you will see various settings that you can adjust:

- **Grid Size:** Choose how large your simulation grid should be.
- **Agent Count:** Decide how many agents you want in the simulation.
- **Simulation Parameters:** Modify settings for agent behavior and interactions.

### 3. Run the Simulation

Click the "Start Simulation" button to see how agents interact within the grid. You may observe their decisions evolve as they adapt to surroundings.

### 4. Analyze Results

After running the simulation, delve into the results. Explore agent behavior, survival rates, and reproductive success. These insights provide a deeper understanding of agent-based modeling.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Autonomous Agents:** Agents make independent decisions based on environment cues.
- **Interactive Simulation:** Adjust parameters and visualize different scenarios.
- **Rich Data Collection:** Gather insights on agent performance and interactions.
- **Analysis Tools:** Draw conclusions based on collected data.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

1. **Application Won't Start**
   - Ensure you have the correct Python version installed.
   - Check that your operating system meets the requirements.

2. **Simulation Runs Slowly**
   - A larger grid may require more resources. Try reducing the grid size or agent count.

3. **Unexpected Behavior**
   - Review your configuration settings to ensure they match your intended simulation design.
